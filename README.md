# Webportal

This module is used for keeping track of all my IoT applications.

Whenever a standalone application with an changing/unknown IP adress is connected, 
it should connect to this webportal to let it know where it is.

Application originally built on spring-boot, migrated to S3 with a static Angular application for cost reasons
